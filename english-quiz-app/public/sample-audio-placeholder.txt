# Sample Audio File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the sample audio file that should be placed in the public directory.

The file should be named `sample-audio.mp3` and should contain a 15-second sample audio clip for testing purposes.

For now, the audio player will show a mock interface. In a real implementation, you would:

1. Add an actual MP3 file to `/public/sample-audio.mp3`
2. Ensure the audio file is approximately 15 seconds long
3. Test the audio playback functionality

The waiting room page is designed to work with or without this audio file - it will gracefully handle the missing file case.
